The second volume of this Springer book continues to highlight the current frontiers of Information Systems (IS) research and practices in Vietnam. It is based on the success of the first volume of the book that has established a shared vision of what we, as the whole IS research community, currently have. The second volume advances Vietnam's IS research stories with a recognition of substantial challenges and opportunities from the emerging technologies and digital business. This book aims to provide a collection of advanced IS research, cases, and applications, which address the challenges and seize the opportunities in the context of Vietnam.

The second volume aims to offer readers an overall picture in the IS field and access to practical IS applications in the context of Vietnam. It illustrates how IS research leverages digital innovation and emerging technologies to design and support individuals and organizations. As a result, it supports not only Vietnamese academics yet international academics, who want to engage with the context of Vietnam. Readers can also compare the context of IS applications between Vietnam as a developing country and other developed countries.

We welcome premium quality submissions that focus on advanced IS research in the context of Vietnam, including cases, applications, and studies on future IS directions, and how to ensure our research can be designed to meet the current IS research trends. In addition to the traditional IS research topics, we welcome design science research advancing the development of innovative IS artifacts. We also welcome real-world case studies on IS design, implementation, and/or adoption by organizations in Vietnam.
