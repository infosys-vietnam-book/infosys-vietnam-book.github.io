The third volume of this Springer book continues to highlight the dynamics of Information Systems (IS) research and practices in Vietnam. It is based on the success of the first and second volumes of the book, that has established a shared vision of what we, as the whole IS research community, currently have. This volume advances Vietnam's IS research stories with a recognition of substantial challenges and opportunities from the emerging technologies and digital business. This book aims to provide a collection of advanced IS research, cases, and applications, which address the challenges and seize the opportunities in the context of Vietnam. It supports not only Vietnamese academics yet international academics, who want to engage with the context of Vietnam. Readers can also compare the context of IS applications between Vietnam as a developing country and other developed countries. 

We welcome high-quality submissions that focus on advanced IS research in the context of Vietnam, including cases, applications, and studies on future IS directions, and how to ensure our research can be designed to meet the current IS research trends. In addition to the traditional IS research topics, we welcome design science research advancing the development of innovative IS artifacts. We also welcome real-world case studies on IS design, implementation, and/or adoption by organizations in Vietnam. 

This volume also highlights two emerging and critical themes: Digital Transformation and Sustainable Development. Digital transformation has been embedded in the 2030 National digital transformation programme of the Vietnamese government, leading to numerous digital businesses that offer significant values in different sectors, including retail, manufacturing, education, and healthcare. On the other hand, United Nation (UN) has recently introduced the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which specify the key areas and collective actions to ensure continuing peace and prosperity for people and the planet. We believe that IS research can contribute great profound impacts on these themes.
